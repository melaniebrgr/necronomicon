## Algorithms

### Runtime Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm; Commonly estimated by counting the number of fixed time, runtime complexity considers the number of elementary operations performed by an algorithm.

Running times may vary between inputs, so a worst-case time complexity approach is assumed. This is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size.

This complexity is expressed as a function of the size of the input, and is hard to estimate exactly, so we focus on the asymptotic behaviour of the complexity.

#### Asymptotic Analysis

Asymptotic Analysis is a method of describing limiting behaviour.

When something is Asymptotic it is said to be approaching a value or curve arbitrarily closesly as some sort of limit is taken.

A line or curve "A" that is Asymptotic to given curve "C" is called the Asymptote of "C".

#### Big-O Notation

Big-O Notation describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends toward a particular value or infinity.

Big-O characterizes functions according to their growth rates. Different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same notation.

It is often helpful to think about the runtime complexity of a function to determine if there's a better (more efficient) solution to the problem you're trying to solve.
